To recap: we saw in this chapter the what and why of blockchain.

## What? 
Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a ‘trustable data record’ built as a distributed system.

## Why? 
Current system of records either lack trust or pay a cost for trust. There is a huge opportunity to solve these issues in current systems of records.

## Next: How? 
In the next 2 chapters we will see from a tech perspective, how blockchain achieves this quality of ‘immutability and trust’.

In the next chapter, we will explain the different pre-requisites for understanding blockchain.
