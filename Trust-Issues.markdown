 ### Trust Issues in the Automobile Industry
I recently imported a used car from another country. If you have bought a used car at some point in your life, you know the trouble and the confusion you must have gone through in order to be able to ‘trust’ the condition of the car (mileage, service history, accident reports, etc.).

There are billions of dollars lost every year due to odometer tampering. In some cases, people have bought a used car and later found there to be a major accident on the car.

On the other hand, as a seller of a used car, if my car is extremely well kept I am not able to fully convince the buyer to get the right value for my well-kept car.

In countries like the US, there are also entities like Carfax, a middleman, which people ‘trust’ to some extent as a keeper of their data. This trust is put into Carfax because there are legal processes in place to hold them accountable if they were to alter the data for any car.

For car service records, we have paper-based car service books, which can, of course, very easily be faked. If one was to take a paper based service record and reconcile it with 10 different service providers to ensure validity of the data, it would be very time-consuming, since all service providers have their own system of records.
