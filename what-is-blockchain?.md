## The key features of Blockchain technology
  + Distribution
  + Immutability

Blockchain is a term used to describe DLT, or Distributed Ledger Technology. Blockchain is used to create a storage system for data in a distributed and immutable manner.

### Immutability
Immutability connotes unchanging, it simply that, when data is written to a **Ledger**, it can never be change, it remains there forever. In contrast, in a standard Relational Database, no matter how much security you implement, the data can be accessed and modified on the file system on which the data is persisted. This could be done by corrupt admin or a hacker.

A blockchain system ensures that even if a bit of data is changed at any level on the ledger, the entire system will report an  <span style="color:red">invalid</span> state. And since the data is distributed on multiple systems, the actual data with a valid state can be recovered from one of the systems.
