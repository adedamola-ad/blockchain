## Terminology
In this lesson, we will explain the different terminologies used so far in this chapter

Since there are multiple terms being used here lets clarify some so there is no confusion:

**LEDGER:** The data store that keeps all blockchain data. 
<br>
**Transaction:** Each entry in the ledger. 
<br>
**Block:** The transactions are timestamped and stored in groups of blocks.
<br>

On the ledger you can only add a new transaction or read the old ones. You can not update or delete anything.

The ledger is designed to be immutable using **cryptographic algorithms** and its distributed design. The ledger is replicated and maintained by multiple hosts or peers or nodes. This is why its called DLT or Distributed Ledger Technology.
